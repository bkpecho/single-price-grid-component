### What I learned

During the development of this project, I gained a deeper understanding of several web development concepts and technologies, including:

-HTML5: I used HTML5 to structure the content of the profile card component and ensure it was semantically correct and accessible.

-CSS3 and SASS: I used CSS3 and SASS to style the profile card component, including creating custom variables and mixins to ensure consistent styling throughout the component.

-BEM: I used the BEM methodology to organize my CSS classes and make my code more modular and maintainable.

-Flexbox: I used Flexbox to create a responsive layout for the single price component, ensuring that it looks great on any device, from mobile to desktop.

-Mobile-first approach: I used a mobile-first approach to design and develop the single price component, starting with the smallest screen size and working my way up to larger screen sizes. This helped ensure that the component was optimized for mobile devices and provided a better user experience across all devices.

Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to apply my knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, SASS, BEM, and Flexbox to create a responsive, mobile-friendly single price component.
